## Mutsa Munyawiri

I have a professional approach to all my work; I have great interpersonal skills and effective planning and conformity to recognized standards in a variety of areas. I've had the pleasure of building on and growing my range of Marketing skills as well as producing actionable insights and results across the Fashion, Music and Business Services industries. Whilst working as a marketer, I had the pleasure of working very closely with Tech, UI & UX teams and spent a couple of days a week learning how to create and modify templates in basic HTML. I am now working towards becoming a creative and tech-centric individual, who spends time creating, testing, and solving problems whilst consistently improving my methodical skills.

## Skills

#### Strategic

In my previous roles, I was taught to be strategic, be it from a theoretically or practically. 
With coding, I can tell that my strategical skills will be put to work and I look forward to adapting them to the new environment.

#### Working Well Under Pressure

I've only ever known how to work under pressure and so it has become the environment in which I thrive in. 
I have learnt to meditate, organise and move on and I plan to incorporate my growing methodical and organisational skills to help strengthen this skill.

#### Analytical

From my time studying, to my last role, I have always taken an analytical approach to building strategy, creating & testing and have always considered the range of relevant factors before taking next steps.

**An example of my Analytical skills put to good use:**

- Whilst working at MOO.COM, I considered short-long term performance data and other business development/ change to create a new and successful strategy for marketing to design students, also known as "Summer's most important customers"
- I contributed to the significant growth of the student customer-base, YoY, two years in a row
- As well as executing design-lead cross-department campaigns, I also designed and implemented design-study-specific landing pages that were influenced by the relevant PPC and on-site search terms, SEO bugs and web-merchandising opportunities
