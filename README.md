## Mutsa Munyawiri

Marketer turned Junior Developer. Iâ€™m passionate about problem-solving, keen to be intellectually challenged and excited to find a role that will allow me to consolidate and extend my programming knowledge. I am a creative and curious individual who really enjoys working within a team, thinking up new ideas as well breaking existing things into little pieces and putting them back together in a more efficient way to make them work better.

## Skills

#### Strategic

In my previous roles, I was taught to be strategic, be it from a theoretical or practical standpoint. 
With coding, I can tell that my strategical skills will be put to work and I look forward to building on them and adapting them to a new professional environment.

#### Adaptable

Working across a range of projects, within different teams, across a business with a wide variety of performance and organic channels is something I really enjoyed doing in my previous roles. I also had the pleasure of working with different groups of people with different skillsets, on a range of projects, at Makers and whilst this wasn't easy at first, I truly enjoyed being a part of a team that worked through team-related challenges to eventually work seamlessly.

#### Working Well Under Pressure

I've only ever known how to work under pressure and so it has become the environment in which I thrive in. 
I have learnt to meditate, organise and move on and I plan to combine my growing methodical and organisational skills to help strengthen this skill.

#### Analytical

From my time studying to my last role, I have always taken an analytical approach to building strategy, creating & testing and have always considered the range of relevant factors before taking next steps.

**An example of my Analytical skills within a professional environment:**

- Whilst working at MOO.COM, I considered short-long term performance data and other business development/ change to create a new and successful strategy for marketing to design students, also known as "Summer's most important customers", this went on to contribute to the significant growth of the student customer-base and database, YoY, two years in a row
- As well as executing design-led, cross-department campaigns, I also designed and implemented vertical-specific landing pages that were influenced by the relevant PPC and on-site search terms, SEO bugs and web-merchandising opportunities

She's since up and shipped the business to South Africa, but I still bake cakes for family, friends and neighbours every month.

I also designed, created and altered wardrobe items in BAFTA nominated short **[Sea View](http://vimeo.com/79130177)**
